  head: Path Finding Visualizer
  description: This project was built to explain which path finding algorithms best suits the need in one of our research tasks.
  issues: Visualizing the way different path finding algorithms is a bit difficult without visual representation.
  task:
    - Visualize the following algorithm
    - Dijkstra's Algorithm
    - Bellman Ford Algorithm
    - Breadth First Search
    - Depth First Search

  message: We were immensely happy with the project as met the standard of our reasearch center and convincing our fellow teammates in choosing the write algorithm for the upcoming research. The project also includes some more self made path finding algorithm which cannot be publicized but are worth mentioning
