  head: Landing page redesign "Reddit"
  description: Firstly, I must tell you reddit is a massive collection of forums where people can share news and content or comment on others. Now a days we have lot many social platforms to import and export the knowledge. As a explorer, I enjoy scolling reddit as compare to other social media platforms. I wanted to learn the basic and for most important things while designing any social media platform. I researched about the positioning of the icons in reddit because reddit website is filled with lot many icons if we observe. In designing positioning performs very crucial role in the product. I search about the user's thinking and usability by comparing other platforms (facebook, instagram, and many more).
